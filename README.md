This is a brownie NFT minting application that I made for my graduating middle school class. 

It contains a contract for the class NFTs, many scripts to define the NFT and its metadata, as well as an unimplemented front end.

To create one of the class NFTs, you simply customize some variables in create_nft.py and run it. You will then get an OpenSeas link to see your randomized NFT of one of my classmates.

The front end currently has a way to connect to a wallet and detect what the user types in the input address line. Otherwise, it is discontinued due to other projects and less time to work on it.
